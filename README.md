# mars-rover-vision
Computer vision for mars rover with MQTT broadcasting. Gif below shows our first full run (without obstacles) where the robot reaches all 6 red markers and the final end position. The glimmer of the lights above massively affected the ability to detect the ArUco code for live PID control of the robot, however even with brief glimpses it could correct itself in time.
